## 🌿 About Me  
I’m an engineering student exploring the world of **embedded systems, IoT development, and PCB design**.  
My work blends **hardware experimentation, signal interpretation, and code that interacts with the real world**.

I’m especially interested in:  
- Developing **data-centric IoT systems** focusing on telemetry structure, event logging, and actionable insights  
- Working with microcontrollers such as **Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi**  
- Using **MATLAB simulation frameworks** to study system dynamics and refine real-world control behaviour
